## üìù Next Immediate Steps

Since you said customers need jobs and photo/video upload, let me start with:

1. **Create Customer Detail Page** with tabs:
   - Info tab (existing data)
   - Jobs tab (add/view jobs)
   - Media tab (upload/view photos/videos)

2. **Update Customer Table** to have "View" button that goes to detail page

Would you like me to start building the customer detail page with jobs and media upload?
