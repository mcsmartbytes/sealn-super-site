# Security Implementation - Seal'n & Stripe'n Specialist

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect customer data and ensure safe operations.

## Data Security Features

### 1. **Database Security (Supabase)**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Admin-only access policies for customer data
- ✅ AES-256 encryption at rest (handled by Supabase)
- ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
- ✅ Audit logging for all customer data changes

**How to apply:** Run `security-policies.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. **Application Security Headers**
Configured in `next.config.js`:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Protects referrer info
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Protected admin routes with `ProtectedRoute` component
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt via Supabase)

### 4. **Data Privacy**
- Customer data never exposed to public
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) marked in database
- Contact form submissions stored securely
- No third-party analytics tracking personal data

### 5. **SSL/HTTPS**
- Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates
- All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enabled
- Security badge displayed on contact form

## Customer Data Protection

### What We Protect:
- Customer names, emails, phone numbers
- Property addresses
- Project details and estimates
- Payment information (when Stripe is integrated)
- Contact form submissions

### How We Protect It:
1. **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Only authenticated admins can view customer data
3. **Audit Trail**: All changes to customer records are logged
4. **Secure Storage**: Hosted on Supabase with SOC 2 Type II compliance
5. **No Data Sharing**: Customer information is never sold or shared

## Next Steps for Enhanced Security

### Phase 1 - Completed ✅
- [x] Row Level Security policies
- [x] Security headers
- [x] SSL/HTTPS verification badge
- [x] Audit logging

### Phase 2 - To Implement
- [ ] Payment integration with Stripe (PCI compliant)
- [ ] Email verification for contact submissions
- [ ] Privacy Policy page
- [ ] Terms of Service page
- [ ] CAPTCHA on contact form (prevent spam)
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for admin login

### Phase 3 - Advanced
- [ ] GDPR compliance features (data export/deletion)
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Automated backup system
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan

## Compliance

### Current Status:
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Via Supabase infrastructure
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act ready
- **PCI DSS**: Ready when Stripe is integrated

### Recommended:
- Add Privacy Policy page
- Add Terms of Service page
- Implement customer data export feature (GDPR)
- Add cookie consent banner (if tracking is added)

## Security Best Practices

### For Admin Users:
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Enable 2FA when available
3. Don't share login credentials
4. Log out after each session
5. Use secure networks (avoid public WiFi)

### For Development:
1. Never commit secrets to git
2. Use environment variables for API keys
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Run `npm audit` regularly
5. Test all user inputs for vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:
1. Immediately notify admin team
2. Document the incident
3. Change all passwords
4. Review audit logs
5. Notify affected customers if data was compromised
6. Implement fixes to prevent recurrence

## Contact
