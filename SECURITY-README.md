# Security Implementation Guide

## Current Security Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL - RLS DISABLED

### What's Wrong?
Row Level Security (RLS) is currently **DISABLED** on all tables. This means:
- Anyone with your anon key can read ALL customer data
- Anyone can modify or delete records
- No access control whatsoever
- Customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is exposed

### How to Fix (Do This NOW)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oloskddnlvqjmxrlehpn

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-security-fix.sql`**
   - Click "Run" to execute

4. **Verify it worked**
   - All queries should succeed
   - Last two queries will show you the enabled RLS status and policies

### What This Does

#### 🔒 Security Model

**Admin Users:**
- Must be authenticated (logged in with Supabase Auth)
- Must be in the `admins` table
- Have full CRUD access to all tables

**Public (Unauthenticated) Users:**
- Can view active services (for the public website)
- Can submit contact form requests
- **Cannot** view customers, estimates, invoices, or any other data

#### 📊 Table-by-Table Breakdown

| Table | Public Read | Public Write | Admin Read | Admin Write |
|-------|------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| services | ✅ (active only) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| customers | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| estimates | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| invoices | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| estimate_items | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| invoice_items | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| jobs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| customer_photos | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| contact_request | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| admins | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| email_logs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Testing After Fix

1. **Test Admin Access:**
   - Log in to your site
   - Navigate to Dashboard - should work
   - Navigate to Customers - should work
   - Try creating/editing data - should work

2. **Test Public Access:**
   - Open an incognito window
   - Try to access https://sealn-super-site.vercel.app/admin
   - Should redirect to login

3. **Test Services Public Access:**
   - Your public website should still be able to fetch services
   - Services page should load correctly

### What if Something Breaks?

If after running the security fix, your admin pages don't work:

**Check if you're in the admins table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM admins;
```

If your email is NOT there, add it:
```sql
INSERT INTO admins (email) VALUES ('your-email@example.com');
```

**Emergency Rollback (DO NOT USE unless necessary):**
```sql
-- Only use this if you need to temporarily disable RLS to fix issues
ALTER TABLE services DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE customers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... etc for all tables
```

### Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Rotate your Supabase anon key** (after RLS is enabled)
   - Go to Settings → API in Supabase
   - Generate new anon key
   - Update `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables

2. **Enable 2FA on your Supabase account**
   - Go to Account Settings
   - Enable two-factor authentication

3. **Set up Supabase Logs monitoring**
   - Check for unusual access patterns
   - Monitor for repeated failed auth attempts

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Review access logs monthly
   - Check for unauthorized admin accounts
   - Verify all policies are still correct

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all data changes
- [ ] Add IP allowlisting for admin access
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA on contact form to prevent spam
- [ ] Add file upload size limits and virus scanning
- [ ] Implement session timeout for inactive users

## Questions?

If you have issues after enabling RLS, check:
1. Are you logged in as an admin?
2. Is your email in the `admins` table?
3. Do the verification queries show RLS enabled?
4. Are there any errors in browser console?
