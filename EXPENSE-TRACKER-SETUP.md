```sql
-- Create expenses table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS expenses (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  receipt_url TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_date ON expenses(date DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_category ON expenses(category);

-- Add trigger for updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_expenses_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON expenses
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Disable RLS for now (consistent with other tables in the project)
ALTER TABLE expenses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Or simply run the `expenses-schema.sql` file located in the project root.
