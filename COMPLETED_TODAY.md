### 4. **Job-Specific Photo Upload** üéØ
**Key Feature:** Each job has a "+ Photo" button!

**How it works:**
1. Customer has multiple jobs (e.g., "Lot A Sealcoating", "Lot B Striping")
2. While at Lot A, you can upload photos specifically for that job
3. Photos are tagged with `job_id` in database
4. Only photos for that job show under that job
5. All photos still visible in Media tab

**Use case:**
- Create job: "Main Parking Lot - July 2025"
- At job site, click "+ Photo" on that job
- Take pictures with phone
- Upload directly to that specific job
- Photos stay organized by job

### 5. **Updated Customer Table**
- Added "View" button (blue) - goes to detail page
- Kept "Edit" button (green) - edit inline
- Kept "Delete" button (red)

## üìä Database Changes (Already in schema)

Tables used:
- `customers` - customer info
- `jobs` - jobs per customer
- `customer_photos` - photos/videos
  - Has `customer_id` (required)
  - Has `job_id` (optional) - links photo to specific job

No changes needed - schema already supports this!
